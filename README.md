# Canary

A browser extension that warns you about potential misinformation/fake news using english deep learning language models

## How it works

1. Select text to check, click "Check veracity of **[text you selected]**"
2. A response with the result will now be returned next to the selected text

## Features to add

- Warn user that more text should be selected for optimal results/higher accuracy (based on current selection length)
  > This should be an opt-in feature (user should explicitly allow this in settings)
- Allow user to select custom thresholds/ranges for verdicts
  > for example, warn that fake only if 70% or more sure
- Allow user to add pages on which the extension would work (wouldn't work on others)
- Create a list of statements for each of classification results (probably movie references)
